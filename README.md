# Synapse Reinforcement Learning

Synapse is a framework for implementing Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms in PyTorch. The repository includes popular algorithms such as Deep Q-Networks, Policy Gradients, and Actor-Critic, as well as others.

One of the advantages of using Synapse-RL is its compatibility with gym-based environments. Gym provides a standard interface for working with environments to benchmark RL models. Synapse-RL also includes various utility functions and classes that make it easy to experiment with different hyperparameters, test different training approaches, and visualize training results.




| RL Algorithm | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Deep Q Learing` | WORKS |
| `Policy Gradient` | WORKS |
| `Actor Critic (A2C)` | ALMOST WORKS |
